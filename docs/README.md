This tool was created by a diabetic, for diabetics. It provides a simple way to keep your Dexcom G7 glucose readings visible on your desktop without having to constantly check your phone or Dexcom receiver.

Here I have it on the top bar of VS Code.

## ü§ñ Development Credits

This project was developed through an AI-human collaboration:

- **AI Development**: The Python code was written almost exclusively by **Roo Code** using the **Claude Sonnet 4** model
- **Project Lead & Planning**: **Kristian** (specializing in .NET and TypeScript) provided the vision, requirements, testing, and close collaboration throughout the development process
- **Collaboration Model**: This represents a successful example of AI-assisted development where domain expertise and AI capabilities combined to create a useful tool for the diabetes community

The project demonstrates how AI can help bring ideas to life even when the project lead's primary expertise lies in different technologies (.NET/TypeScript vs Python).
