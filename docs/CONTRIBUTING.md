## üß™ Testing

Before submitting a pull request, please test:

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Widget launches successfully
- [ ] Credential setup works for new users
- [ ] Widget displays glucose readings correctly
- [ ] Dragging functionality works
- [ ] Right-click menu functions properly
- [ ] Widget persists position between runs
- [ ] Color coding works (green/orange/red)
- [ ] Trend arrows display correctly

### Build Testing
- [ ] Executable builds successfully: `python build_executable.py`
- [ ] Executable runs without Python installed
- [ ] No console window appears when running executable

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Handles network connectivity issues gracefully
- [ ] Manages invalid credentials properly
- [ ] Works with expired/missing glucose data

## üìù Code Style

- **Follow PEP 8** Python style guidelines
- **Use meaningful variable names**
- **Add comments for complex logic**
- **Keep functions focused and small**
- **Handle errors gracefully**

### Example Code Style

```python
def get_glucose_reading(self):
    """Get current glucose reading from Dexcom API"""
    if not self.dexcom:
        return None
        
    try:
        reading = self.dexcom.get_current_glucose_reading()
        if reading:
            self.current_reading = reading
            self.last_update = datetime.now()
        return reading
    except DexcomError as e:
        print(f"Dexcom API error: {e}")
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
        return None
```

## üîí Security Considerations

When contributing, please keep in mind:
